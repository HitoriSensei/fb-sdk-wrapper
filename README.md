# fb-sdk-wrapper
Wraps around the Facebook Javascript SDK to make it usable as a ES6 module. Instead of having to add a script tag to your html like it's still 2010, just import this module and it will do it for you. As a bonus it will provide you with a nicer api by using promises.

## Installing
Use the package manager of your choosing:

```bash
# npm
npm install fb-sdk-wrapper

# yarn
yarn add fb-sdk-wrapper
```
